# MT6765 support

This is supported via [MT6765.py](../src/targets/MT6765.py).
Currently supported functionality:
* âœ… WiFi

## Tested on

The support was tested on:
* SM-T225 (Samsung Galaxy Tab A7 Lite) / MT8768T running [postmarketOS](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_Tab_A7_Lite_(samsung-gta7litewifi))

## Requirements

* Out-of-tree MediaTek connectivity modules
    * `wmt_drv`
    * `wmt_chrdev_wifi`
    * `wlan_drv_gen4m`
* MCU firmware binaries / `wifi.cfg`
    * These can be extracted from the original AOSP distribution from the `/vendor` directory

## Running

```shell
sudo python3 wmt-pyloader.py
```

`wmt-pyloader` takes care of loading the kernel modules, as they need to be loaded in a very specific order to work.

## Technical: Chain of initialization

Rough chain of initialization of the WiFi hardware:

1. *load wmt_drv module*
1. **wmt_loader**   <- implemented by wmt-pyloader
1. *load wmt_chrdev_wifi module*
1. *load wlan_drv_gen4m module*
1. **wmt_launcher**  <- implemented by wmt-pyloader
1. **wlan_assistant**   <- writes NVRAM, but doesn't seem to be required for WiFi to work
